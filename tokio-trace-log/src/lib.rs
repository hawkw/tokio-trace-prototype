//! Adapters for connecting unstructured log records from the `log` crate into
//! the `tokio_trace` ecosystem.
//!
//! This conversion does not convert unstructured data in log records (such as
//! values passed as format arguments to the `log!` macro) to structured
//! `tokio_trace` fields. However, it *does* attach these new events to to the
//! span that was currently executing when the record was logged. This is the
//! primary use-case for this library: making it possible to locate the log
//! records emitted by dependencies which use `log` within the context of a
//! trace.
//!
//! Note that logger implementations that convert log records to trace events
//! should not be used with `Subscriber`s that convert trace events _back_ into
//! log records (such as the `LogSubscriber` in the `tokio_trace` crate), as
//! doing so will result in the event recursing between the subscriber and the
//! logger forever (or, in real life, probably overflowing the call stack)
//!
//! If the logging of trace events generated from log records produced by the
//! `log` crate is desired, either the `log` crate should not be used to
//! implement this logging, or an additional layer of filtering will be
//! required to avoid infinitely converting between `Event` and `log::Record`.
