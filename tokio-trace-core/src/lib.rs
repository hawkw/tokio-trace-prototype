//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! The core of `tokio-trace`'s API is composed of `Event`s, `Span`s, and
//! `Subscriber`s. We'll cover these in turn.
//!
//! # `Span`s
//!
//! A [`Span`] represents a _period of time_ during which a program was executing
//! in some context. A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it
//! begins executing in that context, and to _exit_ the span when switching to
//! another context. The span in which a thread is currently executing is
//! referred to as the _current_ span.
//!
//! Spans form a tree structure --- unless it is a root span, all spans have a
//! _parent_, and may have one or more _children_. When a new span is created,
//! the current span becomes the new span's parent. The total execution time of
//! a span consists of the time spent in that span and in the entire subtree
//! represented by its children. Thus, a parent span always lasts for at least
//! as long as the longest-executing span in its subtree.
//!
//! In addition, data may be associated with spans. A span may have _fields_ ---
//! a set of key-value pairs describing the state of the program during that
//! span; an optional name, and metadata describing the source code location
//! where the span was originally entered.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! An [`Event`] represents a _point_ in time. It signifies something that
//! happened while the trace was executing. `Event`s are comparable to the log
//! records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line,
//! an `Event` may occur within the context of a `Span`. Like a `Span`, it
//! may have fields, and implicitly inherits any of the fields present on its
//! parent span, and it may be linked with one or more additional
//! spans that are not its parent; in this case, the event is said to _follow
//! from_ those spans.
//!
//! Essentially, `Event`s exist to bridge the gap between traditional
//! unstructured logging and span-based tracing. Similar to log records, they
//! may be recorded at a number of levels, and can have unstructured,
//! human-readable messages; however, they also carry key-value data and exist
//! within the context of the tree of spans that comprise a trase. Thus,
//! individual log record-like events can be pinpointed not only in time, but
//! in the logical execution flow of the system.
//!
//! Events are represented as a special case of spans --- they are created, they
//! may have fields added, and then they close immediately, without being
//! entered.
//!
//! # `Subscriber`s
//!
//! As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by
//! implementations of the [`Subscriber`] trait. `Subscriber`s are notified
//! when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These
//! notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:
//! + [`observe_event`], called when an `Event` takes place,
//! + [`enter`], called when execution enters a `Span`,
//! + [`exit`], called when execution exits a `Span`
//!
//! In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`] function to _filter_
//! the notifications they receive based on [metadata] describing each `Span`
//! or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given
//! set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will *not* be notified about the
//! corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently
//! active subscribers express  interest in a given set of metadata by returning
//! `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.
//!
