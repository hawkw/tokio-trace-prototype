//! Subscribers collect and record trace data.
use {span, Event, IntoValue, Meta, SpanId};

/// Trait representing the functions required to collect trace data.
///
/// Crates that provide implementations of methods for collecting or recording
/// trace data should implement the `Subscriber` interface. This trait is
/// intended to represent fundamental primitives for collecting trace events and
/// spans --- other libraries may offer utility functions and types to make
/// subscriber implementations more modular or improve the ergonomics of writing
/// subscribers.
///
/// A subscriber is responsible for the following:
/// - Registering new spans as they are created, and providing them with span
///   IDs. Implicitly, this means the subscriber may determine the strategy for
///   determining span equality.
/// - Recording the attachment of field values and follows-from annotations to
///   spans.
/// - Filtering spans and events, and determining when those filters must be
///   invalidated.
/// - Observing spans as they are entered and exited, and events as they occur.
///
/// When a span is entered or exited, the subscriber is provided only with the
/// [`SpanId`] with which it tagged that span when it was created. This means
/// that it is up to the subscriber to determine whether or not span _data_ ---
/// the fields and metadata describing the span --- should be stored. The
/// [`new_span`] function is called when a new span is created, and at that
/// point, the subscriber _may_ choose to store the associated data if it will
/// be referenced again. However, if the data has already been recorded and will
/// not be needed by the implementations of `enter` and `exit`, the subscriber
/// may freely discard that data without allocating space to store it.
///
/// [`SpanId`]: ::span::Id
/// [`new_span`]: ::Span::new_span

    // === Span registry methods ==============================================

    /// Record the construction of a new [`Span`], returning a a new [span ID] for
    /// the span being constructed.
    ///
    /// Span IDs are used to uniquely identify spans within the context
    /// of a subscriber, so span equality will be based on the returned
    /// ID. Thus, if the subscriber wishes for all spans with the same
    /// metadata to be considered equal, it should return the same ID
    /// every time it is given a particular set of metadata. Similarly,
    /// if it wishes for two separate instances of a span with the same
    /// metadata to *not* be equal, it should return a distinct ID every
    /// time this function is called, regardless of the metadata.
    ///
    /// Subscribers which do not rely on the implementations of `PartialEq`,
    /// `Eq`, and `Hash` for `Span`s are free to return span IDs with value 0
    /// from all calls to this function, if they so choose.

    /// Adds an indication that `span` follows from the span with the id
    /// `follows`.
    ///
    /// This relationship differs somewhat from the parent-child relationship: a
    /// span may have any number of prior spans, rather than a single one; and
    /// spans are not considered to be executing _inside_ of the spans they
    /// follow from. This means that a span may close even if subsequent spans
    /// that follow from it are still open, and time spent inside of a
    /// subsequent span should not be included in the time its precedents were
    /// executing. This is used to model causal relationships such as when a
    /// single future spawns several related background tasks, et cetera.
    ///
    /// If the subscriber has spans corresponding to the given IDs, it should
    /// record this relationship in whatever way it deems necessary. Otherwise,
    /// if one or both of the given span IDs do not correspond to spans that the
    /// subscriber knows about, or if a cyclical relationship would be created

    /// Determines if a span or event with the specified [metadata] would be
    /// recorded.

    /// This is used by the dispatcher to avoid allocating for span construction
    /// if the span would be discarded anyway.

    /// [metadata]: ::Meta
    fn enabled(&self, metadata: &Meta) -> bool;

    /// Returns `true` if the cached result to a call to [`enabled`] for a span
    /// with the given metadata is still valid.
    ///
    /// By default, this function assumes that cached filter results will remain
    /// valid, but should be overridden when this is not the case.
    ///
    /// If this returns `false`, then the prior value may be used. `Subscriber`s
    /// which require their filters to be run every time an event occurs or a
    /// span is entered/exited should always return `true`.
    ///
    /// For example, suppose a sampling subscriber is implemented by
    /// incrementing a counter every time `enabled` is called and only returning
    /// `true` when the counter is divisible by a specified sampling rate. If
    /// that subscriber returns `false` from `should_invalidate_filter`, then
    /// the filter will not be re-evaluated once it has been applied to a given
    /// set of metadata. Thus, the counter will not be incremented, and the span
    /// or event that correspands to the metadata will never be `enabled`.
    ///
    /// Similarly, if a `Subscriber` has a filtering strategy that can be
    /// changed dynamically at runtime, it would need to invalidate any cached
    /// filter results when the filtering rules change.
    ///
    /// A subscriber which manages fanout to multiple other subscribers should
    /// proxy this decision to all of its child subscribers, returning `false`
    /// only if _all_ such children return `false`. If the set of subscribers to
    /// which spans are broadcast may change dynamically, adding a new
    /// subscriber should also invalidate cached filters.

    ///
    /// When an `Event` takes place, this function is called to notify the
    /// subscriber of that event.
    ///
    /// Note that this function is generic over a pair of lifetimes because the
    /// `Event` type is. See the documentation for [`Event`] for details.

    /// of the span.

    /// of the span.
    ///
