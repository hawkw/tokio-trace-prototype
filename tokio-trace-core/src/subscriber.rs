/// Trait representing the functions required to collect trace data.
///
/// Crates that provide implementations of methods for collecting or recording
/// trace data should implement the `Subscriber` interface. This trait is
/// intended to represent fundamental primitives for collecting trace events and
/// spans --- other libraries may offer utility functions and types to make
/// subscriber implementations more modular or improve the ergonomics of writing
/// subscribers.
///
/// A subscriber is responsible for the following:
/// - Registering new spans as they are created, and providing them with span
///   IDs. Implicitly, this means the subscriber may determine the strategy for
///   determining span equality.
/// - Recording the attachment of field values and follows-from annotations to
///   spans.
/// - Filtering spans and events, and determining when those filters must be
///   invalidated.
/// - Observing spans as they are entered, exited, and closed, and events as
///   they occur.
///
/// When a span is entered or exited, the subscriber is provided only with the
/// [`Id`] with which it tagged that span when it was created. This means
/// that it is up to the subscriber to determine whether or not span _data_ ---
/// the fields and metadata describing the span --- should be stored. The
/// [`new_span`] function is called when a new span is created, and at that
/// point, the subscriber _may_ choose to store the associated data if it will
/// be referenced again. However, if the data has already been recorded and will
/// not be needed by the implementations of `enter` and `exit`, the subscriber
/// may freely discard that data without allocating space to store it.
///

    // === Span registry methods ==============================================

    /// Registers a new callsite with this subscriber, returning whether or not
    /// the subscriber is interested in being notified about the callsite.
    ///
    /// By default, this function assumes that the subscriber's filter
    /// represents an unchanging view of its interest in the callsite. However,
    /// if this is not the case, subscribers may override this function to
    /// indicate different interests, or to implement behaviour that should run
    /// once for every callsite.
    ///
    /// This function is guaranteed to be called exactly once per callsite on
    /// every active subscriber. The subscriber may store the keys to fields it
    /// cares in order to reduce the cost of accessing fields by name,
    /// preallocate storage for that callsite, or perform any other actions it
    /// wishes to perform once for each callsite.
    ///
    /// The subscriber should then return an [`Interest`](Interest), indicating
    /// whether it is interested in being notified about that callsite in the
    /// future. This may be `Always` indicating that the subscriber always
    /// wishes to be notified about the callsite, and its filter need not be
    /// re-evaluated; `Sometimes`, indicating that the subscriber may sometimes
    /// care about the callsite but not always (such as when sampling), or
    /// `Never`, indicating that the subscriber never wishes to be notified about
    /// that callsite. If all active subscribers return `Never`, a callsite will
    /// never be enabled unless a new subscriber expresses interest in it.
    ///
    /// `Subscriber`s which require their filters to be run every time an event
    /// occurs or a span is entered/exited should return `Interest::Sometimes`.
    ///
    /// For example, suppose a sampling subscriber is implemented by
    /// incrementing a counter every time `enabled` is called and only returning
    /// `true` when the counter is divisible by a specified sampling rate. If
    /// that subscriber returns `Interest::Always` from `register_callsite`, then
    /// the filter will not be re-evaluated once it has been applied to a given
    /// set of metadata. Thus, the counter will not be incremented, and the span
    /// or event that correspands to the metadata will never be `enabled`.
    ///
    /// Similarly, if a `Subscriber` has a filtering strategy that can be
    /// changed dynamically at runtime, it would need to re-evaluate that filter
    /// if the cached results have changed.

    /// should proxy this decision to all of its child subscribers,

    /// broadcast may change dynamically, the subscriber should also never
    /// return `Interest::Never`, as a new subscriber may be added that _is_
    /// interested.
