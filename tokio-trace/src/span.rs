//! Spans represent periods of time in the execution of a program.
//!
//! # Entering a Span
//!
//! A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it begins executing,
//! and _exit_ the span when it switches to another context. Spans may be
//! entered through the [`enter`](`Span::enter`) method, which enters the target span,
//! performs a given function (either a closure or a function pointer), exits
//! the span, and then returns the result.
//!
//! Calling `enter` on a span handle enters the span that handle corresponds to,
//! if the span exists:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! let my_var = 5;
//! let mut my_span = span!("my_span", my_var = &my_var);
//!
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//! });
//!
//! // Perform some work outside of the context of `my_span`...
//!
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // Perform some more work in the context of `my_span`.
//! });
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # The Span Lifecycle
//!
//! Execution may enter and exit a span multiple times before that
//! span is _closed_. Consider, for example, a future which has an associated
//! span and enters that span every time it is polled:
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # use futures::{Future, Poll, Async};
//! struct MyFuture {
//!    // data
//!    span: tokio_trace::Span,
//! }
//!
//! impl Future for MyFuture {
//!     type Item = ();
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error> {
//!         self.span.enter(|| {
//!             // Do actual future work
//! # Ok(Async::Ready(()))
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If this future was spawned on an executor, it might yield one or more times
//! before `poll` returns `Ok(Async::Ready)`. If the future were to yield, then
//! the executor would move on to poll the next future, which may _also_ enter
//! an associated span or series of spans. Therefore, it is valid for a span to
//! be entered repeatedly before it completes. Only the time when that span or
//! one of its children was the current span is considered to be time spent in
//! that span. A span which is not executing and has not yet been closed is said
//! to be _idle_.
//!
//! Because spans may be entered and exited multiple times before they close,
//! [`Subscriber`]s have separate trait methods which are called to notify them
//! of span exits and span closures. When execution exits a span,
//! [`exit`](::Subscriber::exit) will always be called with that span's ID to
//! notify the subscriber that the span has been exited. If the span has been
//! exited for the final time, the `exit` will be followed by a call to
//! [`close`](::Subscriber::close), signalling that the span has been closed.
//! Subscribers may expect that a span which has closed will not be entered
//! again.
//!
//! If there is only a single handle with the capacity to exit a span, dropping
//! that handle will automatically close the span, since the capacity to enter
//! it no longer exists. For example:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! {
//!     span!("my_span").enter(|| {
//!         // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//!     }); // --> Subscriber::exit(my_span)
//!
//!     // The handle to `my_span` only lives inside of this block; when it is
//!     // dropped, the subscriber will be informed that `my_span` has closed.
//!
//! } // --> Subscriber::close(my_span)
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If one or more handles to a span exist, the span will be kept open until
//! that handle drops. However, a span may be explicitly asked to close by
//! calling the [`Span::close`] method. For example:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! use tokio_trace::Span;
//!
//! let mut my_span = span!("my_span");
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // Signal to my_span that it should close when it exits
//!     Span::current().close();
//! }); // --> Subscriber::exit(my_span); Subscriber::close(my_span)
//!
//! // The handle to `my_span` still exists, but it now knows that the span was
//! // closed while it was executing.
//! my_span.is_closed(); // ==> true
//!
//! // Attempting to enter the span using the handle again will do nothing.
//! my_span.enter(|| {
//!     // no-op
//! });
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! When a span is asked to close by explicitly calling `Span::close`, if it is
//! executing, it will wait until it exits to signal that it has been closed. If
//! it is not currently executing, it will signal closure immediately.
//!
//! Calls to `Span::close()` are *not* guaranteed to close the span immediately.
//! If multiple handles to the span exist, the span will not be closed until all
//! but the one which opened the span have been dropped. This is to ensure that
//! a subscriber never observes an inconsistant state; namely, a span being
//! entered after it has closed.
//!
//! ## Shared spans
//!
//! In general, it is rarely necessary to create multiple handles to a span that
//! persist outside of the period during which that span is executing. Users who
//! wish to have multiple handles capable of entering a span, or enter the same
//! span from multiple threads, may wish to use the [shared span] type instead.
//!
//! A `Shared` handle behaves similarly to a `Span` handle, but may be cloned
//! freely. Any `Shared` handle may be used to enter the span it corresponds to,
//! and (since `Shared` handles are `Send + Sync`) they may be used to allow
//! multiple threads to enter the same span.
//!
//! Shared handles may be created from a span using the [`IntoShared`] trait:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # fn main() {
//! use tokio_trace::span::IntoShared;
//! // Convert a regular `Span` handle into a cloneable `Shared` handle.
//! let span = span!("foo").into_shared();
//!
//! // Entering a `Shared` span handle *consumes* the handle:
//! span.clone().enter(|| {
//!     // ...
//! });
//!
//! // When all `Shared` handles to the span have been consumed, it will close.
//! span.enter(|| {
//!     // ...
//! }) // --> Subscriber::close(span)
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Unlike `Span` handles, `Shared` spans are represented by `Arc` pointers, so
//! constructing them will allocate memory, if the span is enabled.
//!
//! **Note**: When _not_ using shared spans, it is possible to cause a span to
//! _never_ be dropped, by entering it, creating a second handle using
//! `Span::current`, and returning that handle from the closure which executes
//! inside the span, and then dropping that handle while the span is not
//! currently executing. Since the span is not currently executing, it has no
//! way to observe the second handle being dropped, and it cannot determine if
//! it is safe to close.  However, if all such handles are dropped while the
//! span is executing, the span will still be able to close normally. Spans will
//! only  fail to close in situations where the second handle is dropped while
//! the span is _not_ executing.
//!
//! This is possible because the logic for determining if a span can close is
//! intentionally cautious. Spans will only close if they _know_ they cannot be
//! entered; although a span failing to close does result in potentially
//! incorrect trace data, this is less serious of a problem than the
//! inconsistant state that arises when a span is closed and then re-entered.
//! The latter violates the assumptions that a reasonable subscriber
//! implementation could be expected to make.
//!
//!
//! # Accessing a Span's Data
//!
//! The [`Data`] type represents a *non-entering* reference to a `Span`'s data
//! --- a set of key-value pairs (known as _fields_), a creation timestamp,
//! a reference to the span's parent in the trace tree, and metadata describing
//! the source code location where the span was created. This data is provided
//! to the [`Subscriber`] when the span is created; it may then choose to cache
//! the data for future use, record it in some manner, or discard it completely.
//!
//! [`Subscriber`]: ::Subscriber
//! [`State`]: ::span::State
//! [`Data`]: ::span::Data
//! [shared span]: ::span::Shared
//! [`IntoShared`]: ::span::IntoShared
