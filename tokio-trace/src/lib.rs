//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! The core of `tokio-trace`'s API is composed of `Event`s, `Span`s, and
//! `Subscriber`s. We'll cover these in turn.
//!
//! # `Span`s
//!
//! A [`Span`] represents a _period of time_ during which a program was executing
//! in some context. A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it
//! begins executing in that context, and to _exit_ the span when switching to
//! another context. The span in which a thread is currently executing is
//! referred to as the _current_ span.
//!
//! Spans form a tree structure --- unless it is a root span, all spans have a
//! _parent_, and may have one or more _children_. When a new span is created,
//! the current span becomes the new span's parent. The total execution time of
//! a span consists of the time spent in that span and in the entire subtree
//! represented by its children. Thus, a parent span always lasts for at least
//! as long as the longest-executing span in its subtree.
//!
//! Furthermore, execution may enter and exit a span multiple times before that
//! span is _completed_. Consider, for example, a future which has an associated
//! span and enters that span every time it is polled:
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate tokio_trace;
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # use futures::{Future, Poll, Async};
//! struct MyFuture {
//!    // data
//!    span: tokio_trace::Span,
//! }
//!
//! impl Future for MyFuture {
//!     type Item = ();
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error> {
//!         self.span.clone().enter(|| {
//!             // Do actual future work
//! # Ok(Async::Ready(()))
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If this future was spawned on an executor, it might yield one or more times
//! before `poll` returns `Ok(Async::Ready)`. If the future were to yield, then
//! the executor would move on to poll the next future, which may _also_ enter
//! an associated span or series of spans. Therefore, it is valid for a span to
//! be entered repeatedly before it completes. Only the time when that span or
//! one of its children was the current span is considered to be time spent in
//! that span.
//!
//! In addition, data may be associated with spans. A span may have _fields_ ---
//! a set of key-value pairs describing the state of the program during that
//! span; an optional name, and metadata describing the source code location
//! where the span was originally entered.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! An [`Event`] represents a _point_ in time. It signifies something that
//! happened while the trace was executing. `Event`s are comparable to the log
//! records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line,
//! an `Event` always occurs within the context of a `Span`. Like a `Span`, it
//! may have fields, and implicitly inherits any of the fields present on its
//! parent span. Additionally, it may be linked with one or more additional
//! spans that are not its parent; in this case, the event is said to _follow
//! from_ those spans.
//!
//! Essentially, `Event`s exist to bridge the gap between traditional
//! unstructured logging and span-based tracing. Similar to log records, they
//! may be recorded at a number of levels, and can have unstructured,
//! human-readable messages; however, they also carry key-value data and exist
//! within the context of the tree of spans that comprise a trase. Thus,
//! individual log record-like events can be pinpointed not only in time, but
//! in the logical execution flow of the system.
//!
//! # `Subscriber`s
//!
//! As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by
//! implementations of the [`Subscriber`] trait. `Subscriber`s are notified
//! when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These
//! notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:
//! + [`observe_event`], called when an `Event` takes place,
//! + [`enter`], called when execution enters a `Span`,
//! + [`exit`], called when execution exits a `Span`
//!
//! In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`] function to _filter_
//! the notifications they receive based on [metadata] describing each `Span`
//! or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given
//! set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will *not* be notified about the
//! corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently
//! active subscribers express  interest in a given set of metadata by returning
//! `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.
//!
